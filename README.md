This is project for my bachlor thesis. 

This bachelor thesis is focused to edge detection using the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. I focus on noise reduction, searching for isolated edges and finding optimal parameters for the majority of pictures.

You need OpenCV installed to run this application.

The text is only in Czech.
